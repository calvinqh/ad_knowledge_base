'''
    A script that will upload ROSMAP_RNASeq_entrez.csv onto a mongo cluster.
    This script can be generalized for any csv file.

    Instructions: 
    User must set the server ip and port for the mongo cluster.
    The user must also specify csv file they wish to upload.
    The data will be uploaded in json format. 
    Each field in the csv will act as a key.
    Each row will become a document.
